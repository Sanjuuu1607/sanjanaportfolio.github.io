        <h2>Here's the story of My Blog - Antariksh</h2>
        <p>When I am not coding, you will find me gazing at the sky. I am also an Astronomy geek apart from a coding freak. Anything that involves astronomy and data science; count me in! Data science has already found its way into Astronomy and most of the world's population is crazy about Data science. So why not help people expand their horizons about Astronomy with whatever I know? And thus this blog was born!

        <p>I need not tell you more about my blog. It speaks for itself. So go on and have a look!</p>
